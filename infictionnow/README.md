# Digital Language Arts Web Site using Binder (see below)

The hosted site itself is tiny and lives on DreamHost, administered by John_Cayley@brown.edu

Content files are, for the most part Google Docs, also administered by John Cayley and shared with collaborators as required from his Brown.edu Google Drive. The path to the content files is:
```
<My Drive>/BrownGDrive2013/Binder_Brown/dla/
```

File names or landing places for Menu Items are given below (since the info.json file only has Google's obscure links).

Docs for these links should be, at least, shared as visible to 'anyone with the link' and should be published using Google's File --> Publish to the web ... facility. Then just copy the URL part of the 'Embed' link provided into the info.json file.
